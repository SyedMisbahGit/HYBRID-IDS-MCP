## Overview

This document explains the **two-tier detection pipeline** architecture that I designed and implemented for my Hybrid IDS system, making it unique and intelligent.

## 🎯 Core Concept: Two-Tier Detection with Feedback Loop

### The Problem

Traditional IDS systems face a dilemma:
- **Signature-based IDS**: Fast but only catches known threats
- **Anomaly-based IDS**: Catches unknown threats but slower and has false positives

### Our Solution: Two-Tier Pipeline

**Sequential Processing:**
1. All traffic goes through **S-IDS (Tier 1)** first
2. Only traffic that passes S-IDS goes to **A-IDS (Tier 2)**
3. A-IDS anomalies are reviewed by analysts
4. Confirmed anomalies create new S-IDS signatures

**Result:** Best of both worlds + continuous improvement!

## 🔄 Traffic Flow Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Network Traffic Enters System

```
Internet → Network Interface → Hybrid IDS
```

All incoming network packets are captured by the system.

### Step 2: TIER 1 - Signature-Based Detection (S-IDS)

```
Packet → S-IDS Rule Engine
```

**What happens:**
- Fast pattern matching against known attack signatures
- Rules for SQL injection, XSS, port scans, etc.
- Written in C++ for maximum performance

**Two possible outcomes:**

#### Outcome 2A: MALICIOUS (Known Threat)
```
S-IDS detects match → Alert logged → Dashboard notified → DONE
```
- Alert sent to `nids_alerts.log`
- Packet is flagged, process complete
- Fast detection (microseconds)

#### Outcome 2B: BENIGN (or Unknown)
```
S-IDS finds no match → Traffic proceeds to Tier 2
```
- Could be legitimate traffic
- Could be zero-day attack (unknown pattern)
- Needs deeper analysis

### Step 3: TIER 2 - Anomaly-Based Detection (A-IDS)

```
"Benign" traffic → Feature Extraction → ML Analysis
```

**What happens:**
- C++ feature extractor computes 78 statistical features
- Features include: packet rates, byte distributions, flow patterns, etc.
- Python ML engine analyzes features using:
  - Random Forest classifier
  - Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)

**Two possible outcomes:**

#### Outcome 3A: BENIGN (Normal Traffic)
```
A-IDS: "Looks normal" → Traffic allowed → No alert
```
- ML models predict normal behavior
- Low anomaly score
- Traffic is truly safe

#### Outcome 3B: MALICIOUS (Anomaly Detected!)
```
A-IDS: "Suspicious!" → Alert + Manual Review Queue
```

This is where it gets interesting...

### Step 4: Manual Review System (The Feedback Loop)

When A-IDS detects an anomaly:

```
A-IDS Alert → Dashboard (2 destinations)
              ├─> Alert Log (ai_alerts.log)
              └─> Manual Review Queue (Kibana table)
```

**Human Analyst Reviews:**
1. Analyst sees anomaly in dashboard
2. Examines packet details, features, context
3. Makes decision:

**Decision A: False Positive**
```
Analyst: "Actually benign" → Mark as false positive → ML retraining data
```

**Decision B: True Threat (CONFIRMED)**
```
Analyst: "Real threat!" → Extract pattern → Create new S-IDS rule
```

### Step 5: Feedback Loop Closes

```
Confirmed Anomaly → New Signature → S-IDS Rule Database → System Updated
```

**Next time this threat appears:**
- S-IDS (Tier 1) catches it immediately
- No need for ML analysis
- Faster detection
- Lower resource usage

---

## 🏠 Parallel: Host-Based IDS (HIDS)

While network traffic flows through the two-tier pipeline, HIDS operates independently:

```
Host System Events
├─> File Integrity Monitor (watches critical files)
├─> Log Analyzer (scans system logs)
└─> Process Monitor (tracks running processes)
     │
     └─> hids_alerts.log → Dashboard
```

**HIDS is parallel because:**
- Host events are independent of network traffic
- Detects threats that don't show up on network
- Examples: Local privilege escalation, rootkits, file tampering

## 📊 Central Dashboard: Intelligence Hub

All detection sources feed into the ELK Stack:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           CENTRAL DASHBOARD             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  • S-IDS alerts (nids_alerts.log)       │
│  • A-IDS alerts (ai_alerts.log)         │
│  • HIDS alerts (hids_alerts.log)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🧠 Why This Architecture is Intelligent

### 1. **Efficient Resource Usage**

- S-IDS is fast (C++, simple pattern matching)
- Most traffic is legitimate → caught by S-IDS
- Only suspicious traffic goes through expensive ML analysis

### 2. **Adaptive Learning**

- System learns from experience
- Human analyst validates ML findings
- Validated threats become signatures
- Detection improves over time

### 3. **Best of Both Worlds**

| Detection Method | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Solution |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Signature-based | Fast, low false positives | Misses unknown threats | Use as Tier 1 |
| Anomaly-based | Catches zero-days | Slow, false positives | Use as Tier 2 |
| Human Review | High accuracy | Doesn't scale | Use for validation only |
| **Our Hybrid** | **Fast + Adaptive + Accurate** | **Complexity** | **Worth it!** |

### 4. **Defense in Depth**

Multiple independent detection layers:
- Network Tier 1 (S-IDS)
- Network Tier 2 (A-IDS)
- Host Layer (HIDS)
- Human Layer (Analyst)

An attacker must evade ALL layers to succeed.

## 🔬 Example Scenario: Zero-Day Attack

Let's trace a **never-before-seen SQL injection variant**:

### Day 1: First Attack
```
1. New SQL injection → S-IDS (no matching rule) → Passes to A-IDS
2. A-IDS: "Unusual query pattern detected!" → Alert
3. Analyst reviews: "Confirmed - new SQL injection technique"
4. Analyst creates new S-IDS rule for this pattern
```

### Day 2: Same Attack
```
1. Same SQL injection → S-IDS (NEW RULE MATCHES) → Alert immediately
2. A-IDS never sees it (already caught)
3. Fast detection, less CPU usage
```

**Result:** System evolved! Unknown threat became known threat.
