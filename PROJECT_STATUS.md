## 📝 Notes & Observations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **C++ Standard:** C++17 (good balance of features and compiler support)
2. **Packet Capture:** libpcap initially (DPDK optional for later optimization)
3. **IPC Mechanism:** ZeroMQ (flexible, performant, language-agnostic)
4. **ML Framework:** PyTorch (better for research, easier debugging than TensorFlow)
5. **Build System:** CMake (industry standard for C++ projects)

### Lessons Learned

- Comprehensive planning upfront saves time later
- Clear documentation is essential for complex projects
- Breaking down tasks into weekly goals helps track progress
